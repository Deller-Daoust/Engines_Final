The Singleton Folder houses the Game Manager script.
The Factory Folder houses the Tetromino Factory script.
The Command folder houses the Input Behaviour script.

In the Tetrimoni Factory Script, blocks are made, instantiated, pooled, and spawned when they need to be.

In the Input Behaviour Script, inputs are queued as commands to be iterated over, over time.
